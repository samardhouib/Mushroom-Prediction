# Mushroom-Prediction
I created a predictive model to determine mushroom edibility using machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees. Utilizing Python libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas, I analyzed a dataset of mushroom characteristics and developed an accurate classification system. This model significantly improved classification accuracy, aiding users in identifying edible and poisonous mushrooms and underscoring the value of machine learning in real-world applications.
